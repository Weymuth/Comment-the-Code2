# Hello Git! 👋

Welcome to your first GitHub Classroom assignment!

## What You Need To Do

This assignment has **one goal**: practice the Git workflow.

### Your Task

1. **Open** this project in VS Code
2. **Edit** the file `src/main.cpp`
   - Find the section that says "YOUR NAME AND DATE GO HERE"
   - Add your name and today's date
3. **Save** the file (Ctrl+S on PC, Cmd+S on Mac)
4. **Commit** your changes using VS Code's Source Control panel
   - Write a commit message like "Added my name"
   - Click the checkmark ✓
5. **Push** your changes to GitHub
   - Click "Sync Changes" or the cloud icon

### How To Know You're Done

Go to github.com and look at your repository. If you can see your name in the `src/main.cpp` file, you did it! 🎉

---

## Stuck?

- Can't find Source Control? Look for the icon that looks like a branch (Y shape) in VS Code's left sidebar
- Don't see your changes? Make sure you saved the file first!
- Push not working? VS Code might ask you to sign into GitHub - follow the prompts

Ask your coach if you're still stuck!
