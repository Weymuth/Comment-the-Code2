 * Comment the Code!
 * ===================================
 * 
 * Welcome to your second Git assignment!
 * 
 * Task: Below is a working program with NO comments. Your job is to add comments that explain what the code does and WHY each part exists.
 * This is a real-world skill—you'll often inherit uncommented code from teammates or past projects.
 *  Rules:
•	Add a file header block comment at the top
•	Add section headers (like // ===== HARDWARE OBJECTS =====)
•	Add inline comments explaining non-obvious lines
•	Add a block comment before each function explaining its purpose
  * Save this file (Ctrl+S on PC, Cmd+S on Mac)
  * Commit your changes using VS Code's Source Control panel
  * 4. Push your changes to GitHub
